### Exercise 1:

I adjusted the price of a delivery using a switch statement on the vehicle string given in the request.

### Exercise 2: 

I create a HTML index page with CSS styling for a web interface.

I used JavaScript with the jQuery library to perform form validation so that the given vehicle is valid.

I used jQuery's ajax to fetch the result of the query and put it into the HTML without refreshing the page.

I was unable to resolve a 405 error that occurs when the form submit sends a post request to the server. I believe there is some discrepency between the parameter expected by the 'quote' function in 'QuoteController' and the Quote object sent in the post request. However, it may also have been due to the fact that the machine I was developing on was a terminal to a central server.
